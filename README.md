# Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions

This repository has been created to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms. It includes solutions to various interview questions, implemented in Swift.

## Content

The repository contains solutions using different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and more. Each folder is dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm and includes the relevant solutions.

## Usage

Each solution is available as a directly executable Swift file. You can run these files in your local environment to see the solutions in action.
